<h2>Part 1: Building the Network</h2>
<br />

<b>1. Adding the Network Devices to the Workspace</b> 
<p>•The first step involved adding network devices to the workspace, including a PC, a laptop, and a cable modem. The cable modem connects to the ISP via a coaxial cable and to the local network via an Ethernet cable.</p>


<b>2. Adding the Physical Cabling Between Devices</b> 
<p>•Next, I connected the PC to the wireless router using a copper straight-through cable.</p>

<h2>Part 2: Configuring the End Devices and Verifying Connectivity
</h2>
<br />

<b>1. Configuring the PC</b> 
<p>•To configure the PC, I enabled DHCP in the IP Configuration tab to obtain an IP address.</p>
